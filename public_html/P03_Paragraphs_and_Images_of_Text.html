        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            <img src="Image_2.png" alt="Image 2"/><br />

                    this.element = element;
                    this.canClose = canClose;
                    this.closeHandler = function () { if (closeHandler) closeHandler() };
                }
            </code>
